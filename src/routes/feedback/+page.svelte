<h2>Aug 3, 2023</h2>

In the previous update I implemented a new system for charts and widgets. I had to delete all chart
widgets and the queries they were using. I'm very sorry for this, but it was necessary to move
forward. It enabled the ability to create Community Widgets which are super cool!
<br />
<br />
If you have issues recreating your charts let me know and I can help you out.

Creating a form here is a little low on the task list, but I am very responsive over email.
<br />Please include my name (Zac) to ensure it does not get sent to spam.

I'll write my email below in a format that bots hopefully won't be able to grab.
