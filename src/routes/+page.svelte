<h1>Welcome to the Climbing Notebook</h1>
<hr />

<p>
	<br />
	This website is a no-fluff set of tools to help climbers with their training.
	<br />
	This is a <b>very early version</b> and is actively being worked on by myself only.
	<br />
	I am currently jobless and am willing to work on this nearly full time right now.
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>If you want to help out</b> we can chat about what tooling you want added next.
